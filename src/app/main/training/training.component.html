          <h3>How Are Your Communication Skills?</h3>

          <p>That&rsquo;s a <strong>supremely important question</strong>, because a recent survey of nearly 1,000 employers shows that <strong>communication skills</strong> top the list of what employers look&nbsp;for.</p>

      <p>Likewise, have you ever watched a celebrity or athlete being interviewed and, for some hard-to-pin-point reason, he or she just wasn&rsquo;t able to project the &ldquo;personal brand image&rdquo; you thought he or she would? While you couldn&rsquo;t put your finger exactly on WHY, you knew that something just didn&rsquo;t look, sound, or feel&nbsp;right.</p>

      <p>autom&auml;tik&rsquo;s executive team has helped develop and enhance the communications skills of thousands of men and woman from myriad marketplace sectors. However, our most common <strong>private</strong> request sounds something like this: &ldquo;Can you help ME become a radically more effective communicator?&rdquo; Our heartfelt answer: &ldquo;Yes. Yes we&nbsp;can.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>A <strong>mentor</strong> is someone who offers their knowledge, expertise, and advice to those with less experience. By leveraging their experience and skills, <em>effective</em> mentors help guide mentees in the right&nbsp;direction.</p>

      <p>With that in mind, the highest priority of an <strong>autom&auml;tik Private Communications Mentor</strong> is to help our mentees develop important and powerful communications skills that are not just relevant in their present position, but also for whatever their future may hold.  Therefore, whether you are an athlete desiring to interview more effectively and radically enhance your &ldquo;personal brand,&rdquo; a media host or politician eager to eliminate &ldquo;filler words&rdquo; from your vocabulary, or a recent graduate hoping to nail your next interview, <strong>WE CAN ABSOLUTELY HELP&nbsp;YOU!</strong></p>
